# Camera Vocabulary Reference

Extended cinematography terminology for Veo 3 prompts.

## Camera Movements

### Horizontal Movements
- **Pan left/right** - Camera rotates horizontally on fixed point
- **Tracking shot** - Camera moves laterally with subject
- **Crab shot** - Sideways dolly movement
- **Arc shot** - Camera moves in circular path around subject

### Vertical Movements
- **Tilt up/down** - Camera rotates vertically on fixed point
- **Crane shot** - Camera physically rises or lowers
- **Jib shot** - Sweeping vertical movement
- **Pedestal up/down** - Camera moves straight up/down

### Depth Movements
- **Dolly in/out** - Camera moves toward/away from subject
- **Push in** - Slow dolly toward subject for emphasis
- **Pull back** - Dolly away, often revealing context
- **Zoom in/out** - Lens focal length changes (different from dolly)

### Complex Movements
- **Steadicam shot** - Smooth floating movement
- **Handheld** - Natural shake, documentary feel
- **360-degree shot** - Full rotation around subject
- **Vertigo/dolly zoom** - Dolly + zoom creating disorientation

## Shot Types by Distance

### Extreme Long Shot (ELS)
Subject tiny in vast environment. Establishes scale and isolation.

### Long Shot / Wide Shot
Full body visible with environment context.

### Full Shot
Subject head to toe, minimal environment.

### Medium Long Shot (MLS) / American Shot
Subject from knees up.

### Medium Shot (MS)
Subject from waist up. Standard dialogue framing.

### Medium Close-Up (MCU)
Subject from chest up.

### Close-Up (CU)
Face fills frame. Shows emotion.

### Extreme Close-Up (ECU)
Single feature (eyes, lips, hands).

### Insert Shot
Detail shot of object or action.

## Camera Angles

### Height Angles
- **Eye level** - Neutral, conversational
- **Low angle** - Looking up, makes subject powerful/imposing
- **High angle** - Looking down, makes subject vulnerable/small
- **Bird's eye** - Directly overhead
- **Worm's eye** - From ground looking up

### Orientation Angles
- **Straight-on** - Camera perpendicular to subject
- **Three-quarter angle** - 45 degrees to subject
- **Profile** - 90 degrees, side view
- **Over-the-shoulder (OTS)** - From behind one character toward another

### Dutch Angle
Camera tilted on axis. Creates unease or dynamism.

## Lens Characteristics

### Focal Length Effects
- **Wide angle (14-35mm)** - Expansive, slight distortion, deep focus
- **Normal (50mm)** - Natural perspective, how eye sees
- **Telephoto (85-200mm)** - Compressed depth, subject isolation
- **Extreme telephoto (200mm+)** - Extreme compression, surveillance feel

### Depth of Field
- **Shallow DOF** - Subject sharp, background blurred (bokeh)
- **Deep focus** - Everything in focus
- **Rack focus** - Shift focus between subjects
- **Split diopter** - Two focal planes simultaneously

### Special Lenses
- **Anamorphic** - Widescreen with horizontal lens flares
- **Macro** - Extreme close-up capability
- **Fisheye** - Extreme wide with barrel distortion
- **Tilt-shift** - Selective focus plane, miniature effect

## Composition Terms

### Framing
- **Headroom** - Space above subject's head
- **Lead room/nose room** - Space in direction subject faces
- **Negative space** - Empty area in frame
- **Tight framing** - Subject fills frame, claustrophobic
- **Loose framing** - Subject has space, breathing room

### Rule of Thirds
Subject placed at intersection of imaginary 3x3 grid.

### Symmetrical Composition
Subject centered, balanced frame.

### Leading Lines
Environmental lines draw eye to subject.

### Frame Within Frame
Subject viewed through doorway, window, or other element.

## Movement Descriptors

### Speed
- Slow/gentle
- Moderate/steady
- Fast/rapid
- Whip (extremely fast)

### Quality
- Smooth
- Fluid
- Floating
- Jerky
- Shaky
- Controlled
- Organic

### Purpose
- Following
- Revealing
- Emphasizing
- Surveying
- Approaching
- Retreating

## Combining Terms

Example combinations for precise camera direction:

```
Slow dolly in, medium shot, shallow depth of field, eye level
```

```
Handheld tracking shot, following subject from behind, wide angle lens
```

```
Crane shot starting low on subject, ascending to reveal bird's eye view of landscape
```

```
Static wide shot, deep focus, symmetrical composition, centered subject
```
