# Veo Establishing Shot Examples

## Urban Location Reveal

### Setup
- Introducing a city setting
- Dawn atmosphere
- Cinematic crane movement

### Prompt

```
Crane shot starting at street level on an empty sidewalk, wet from
recent rain, slowly ascending to reveal a sprawling metropolis at dawn.
Skyscrapers pierce through low-hanging fog, their windows beginning to
glow with early office lights. The sun breaks the horizon, casting long
golden rays between buildings.

Cinematic wide shot, epic scale, awe-inspiring mood, warm golden light
mixing with cool blue shadows. Ambient: city beginning to wake, distant
traffic hum, birds. SFX: gentle wind.
```

## Interior Space Introduction

### Setup
- Entering a diner for the first time
- Nostalgic atmosphere
- Character-less scene setter

### Prompt

```
Slow dolly in through the glass door of a 1950s-style chrome diner.
Red vinyl booths line the windows, checkered floor tiles gleam under
warm fluorescent tubes. A long counter with spinning stools, a vintage
jukebox in the corner glowing amber. Coffee pots steam on burners.
The place is empty, waiting.

Nostalgic, warm, inviting atmosphere, slightly desaturated like faded
color film. Ambient: soft 50s doo-wop from jukebox, coffee percolating,
refrigerator hum. SFX: door chime fading.
```

## Natural Landscape

### Setup
- Remote wilderness
- Establishing isolation
- Epic scale

### Prompt

```
Aerial drone shot sweeping over an endless desert landscape at sunset.
Red rock formations cast dramatic shadows across rippled sand dunes.
A single winding road cuts through the emptiness, no vehicles in sight.
Camera slowly rotates, revealing purple mountains on the distant horizon.

Epic western aesthetic, vast and desolate, awe-inspiring solitude.
Rich saturated colors - orange, red, purple. Ambient: wind across sand,
perfect silence otherwise. The loneliness is palpable.
```

## Building/Location Exterior

### Setup
- Introducing a key location
- Ominous tone
- Night setting

### Prompt

```
Static wide shot, a decrepit Victorian mansion sits atop a hill,
silhouetted against a stormy sky. Lightning flickers in the clouds,
briefly illuminating peeling paint and broken shutters. A single
window on the third floor glows with dim, flickering candlelight.
Dead trees frame the scene like gnarled fingers.

Gothic horror atmosphere, ominous and foreboding, high contrast.
Deep shadows, pale sickly moonlight between clouds. Ambient: wind
howling, thunder rumbling, creaking wood. SFX: lightning crack,
distant wolf howl.
```

## Time Transition Establishing

### Setup
- Same location, showing time passage
- Dawn to day transition
- 8-second time-lapse feel

### Prompt

```
Wide static shot of a mountain valley. Time-lapse style: the sky
transitions from pre-dawn purple to golden sunrise to bright midday.
Shadows sweep dramatically across the valley floor. Mist in the valley
burns away as the sun rises. Wildflowers seem to turn toward the light.

Majestic natural beauty, peaceful yet dynamic, wonder and reverence.
Lush saturated nature colors. Ambient: birdsong increasing in intensity,
stream flowing, wind through grass.
```

## Tips for Establishing Shots

1. **Set the mood first** - These shots prime the audience's emotions
2. **Use movement purposefully** - Crane/drone reveals scale and geography
3. **Include environmental details** - Weather, time of day, condition
4. **Consider what's absent** - Empty spaces suggest waiting or aftermath
5. **Layer ambient audio** - Location sounds ground the viewer
6. **Match aesthetic to genre** - Warm for comfort, cold for tension
