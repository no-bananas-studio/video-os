[00:00-00:02] Low angle tracking shot, a woman in a leather jacket
sprints down a rain-slicked alley, splashing through puddles, glancing
over her shoulder in fear. SFX: rapid footsteps, heavy breathing.

[00:02-00:04] POV shot from her perspective, racing toward a chain-link
fence at the end of the alley. Hands come into frame reaching for the
fence. SFX: continued running, chain-link rattling.

[00:04-00:06] Wide shot from above, she scrambles over the fence and
drops to the other side, stumbling but recovering. SFX: metal fence
shaking, grunt of effort, landing impact.

[00:06-00:08] Medium shot, she presses against a brick wall, catching
her breath, eyes scanning. Distant flashlight beams sweep the alley
behind her. SFX: heavy breathing slowing, distant shouts.

Night, neon signs reflecting in wet pavement, high contrast, thriller
atmosphere, handheld camera feel for urgency.

- Close quarters
- 6-second clip

### Prompt

```
Medium shot, two martial artists face off in a dimly lit dojo.
The first fighter, a tall man in black, throws a spinning kick.
The second, a shorter woman in white, ducks under it and counters
with a palm strike to his chest.

He staggers back, she presses forward with a combination of strikes.
He blocks the last one, they lock arms, straining against each other.

Dramatic side lighting creating long shadows, dust particles visible
in light shafts from high windows, intense and focused atmosphere.
SFX: fabric whooshing, impacts of strikes, grunts of effort, bare
feet on wooden floor.

```
[00:00-00:03] Interior medium shot from passenger seat, a focused
driver grips the steering wheel, eyes intense, yanking the wheel hard
right. Through windshield: city street blurs, headlights of pursuing
car visible in rearview mirror.

[00:03-00:05] Wide exterior tracking shot, the sedan drifts around a
corner, tires smoking, narrowly missing a parked car. The pursuing
black SUV follows, more reckless.

past camera, wind and debris following. Tail lights disappear into
the rainy night.

Night, wet streets, orange sodium vapor streetlights, cinematic car
chase aesthetic, 1970s thriller vibe. SFX: engine roaring, tires
squealing, rain on metal, distant sirens.

## Tips for Action Sequences

1. **Use timestamp prompting** - Break complex action into clear beats
2. **Vary shot distances** - Mix wide (context) with close (detail)
3. **Include movement sounds** - Footsteps, impacts, fabric
4. **Describe motion blur** - Suggests speed and urgency
5. **Layer environmental audio** - Ground the action in space
6. **Keep each beat focused** - One clear action per timestamp
