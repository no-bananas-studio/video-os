# Veo Dialogue Scene Examples

## Two-Person Conversation

### Setup
- Two characters in an office
- Tense negotiation
- Film noir aesthetic

### Prompt

```
Medium two-shot, a grizzled private detective in a rumpled suit sits
behind a cluttered wooden desk, across from an elegant woman in a red
dress and black gloves. The detective leans back, studying her with
suspicion. The woman says with cool detachment, "I need you to find
someone. Someone who doesn't want to be found."

The detective replies in a weary voice, "Lady, in this city, everyone's
hiding from something."

Film noir aesthetic, high contrast lighting with venetian blind shadows
across the scene, cigarette smoke curling in the air, moody jazz ambient.
SFX: distant city traffic, clock ticking.
```

## Single Character Monologue

### Setup
- Character alone, speaking to camera/audience
- Emotional confession
- Intimate close-up

### Prompt

```
Close-up, a young man with tired eyes and three-day stubble, tears
welling. He speaks directly to camera with trembling voice, "I never
meant for any of this to happen. You have to believe me. When I left
that night... I thought I was doing the right thing."

Shallow depth of field, warm but dim lamp light from the side, cool
blue moonlight from window behind. Intimate, confessional mood.
Ambient: quiet room tone, distant rain. SFX: his breath, slight sniff.
```

## Phone Conversation (One Side)

### Setup
- Character on phone
- Receiving bad news
- Showing reaction

### Prompt

```
Medium close-up, a businesswoman in a tailored blazer holds phone to
ear, face shifting from neutral to shock. She says urgently, "What do
you mean they're gone? All of them?"

She pauses, listening, her free hand gripping the edge of her desk.
"No. No, that's not possible. I just spoke to them yesterday."

Corporate office setting, harsh overhead fluorescent lighting mixed with
computer screen glow, clinical and cold atmosphere. SFX: muffled voice
from phone, her sharp intake of breath.
```

## Tips for Dialogue Scenes

1. **Quote dialogue exactly** - Use quotation marks with tone indicators
2. **Include reactions** - Show listening, not just speaking
3. **Layer audio** - Combine dialogue with ambient and SFX
4. **Match lighting to mood** - Warm for intimate, harsh for tension
5. **Consider shot coverage** - Medium for context, close-up for emotion
