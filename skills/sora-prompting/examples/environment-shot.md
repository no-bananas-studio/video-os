# Sora Environment Shot Examples

## Empty Interior - Diner

### Setup
- Location establishment
- No characters
- Mood-setting atmosphere

### Prompt

```
Wide establishing shot, interior of 1950s American diner, early morning
before opening. Red vinyl booths along windows, chrome counter with
spinning stools, checkered floor tiles. Jukebox in corner, unlit.

Cinematography: 24mm lens, eye level, static shot, deep focus
Light: Pre-dawn blue through windows, warm amber from kitchen pass-through,
neon "OPEN" sign off but visible
Palette: Cherry red vinyl, cream formica, chrome silver, checkered black/white

Actions: Camera holds static for four seconds. At second four, the
kitchen light flickers once. Dust motes drift in the early light.

Style: Edward Hopper painting quality, contemplative stillness,
saturated Kodachrome color
Audio cue: Refrigerator hum, distant truck passing
```

## Exterior Urban - Rainy Street

### Setup
- City atmosphere
- Weather element
- Night mood

### Prompt

```
Wide shot, empty city street at 2 AM after rain. Wet asphalt reflects
neon signs and streetlights in long streaks. Steam rises from subway
grate. Parked cars line both sides. No people.

Cinematography: 35mm lens, low angle from street level, static
Light: Neon signs in pink and blue, sodium vapor streetlights amber,
reflected and doubled in wet pavement
Palette: Deep blue-black, hot pink neon, amber streetlight, silver rain

Actions: Static hold for three seconds. A single car passes slowly
through frame left to right, headlights sweeping across wet ground,
taillights leaving red streaks in reflections.

Style: Neo-noir, Wong Kar-wai influence, saturated neon colors
Audio cue: Distant traffic hiss, water dripping from awning
```

## Natural Landscape - Desert

### Setup
- Epic scale
- Slow subtle movement
- Golden hour

### Prompt

```
Extreme wide shot, desert landscape at golden hour. Red rock formations
cast long purple shadows across rippled sand. Single twisted joshua tree
in middle distance. Mountains on horizon, layered in atmospheric haze.

Cinematography: 50mm lens, slightly elevated angle, slow dolly right
(almost imperceptible movement)
Light: Low sun from camera-left, deep golden, long shadows stretching
right. Sky gradient from pale yellow to deep blue.
Palette: Burnt orange, dusty gold, purple shadow, pale blue sky

Actions: Near-static. Gentle wind moves sand grains across dune ridge.
Joshua tree branches sway slightly. Shadow edges creep almost imperceptibly.

Style: Terrence Malick, 65mm film texture, epic and contemplative
Audio cue: Wind across sand, vast emptiness
```

## Interior Dramatic - Abandoned Space

### Setup
- Decay and atmosphere
- Dramatic lighting
- Mystery mood

### Prompt

```
Medium wide shot, abandoned theater auditorium. Rows of dusty velvet
seats face a stage with tattered curtain hanging askew. Debris on floor.
Single shaft of light from hole in ceiling illuminates center aisle.

Cinematography: 28mm lens, center aisle POV, static shot, deep focus
Light: Single dramatic shaft from above, dust particles dancing in beam.
Darkness everywhere else with subtle detail visible in shadows.
Palette: Faded burgundy velvet, gilded plaster now gray, dust-gold
light shaft, deep shadow black

Actions: Hold static for full duration. Dust motes swirl slowly in
light shaft. A piece of ceiling plaster falls in distant darkness,
catching a glint of light.

Style: Tarkovsky influence, contemplative decay, natural degradation
Audio cue: Distant drip, settling building sounds, profound silence
```

## Tips for Environment Shots

1. **Empty spaces tell stories** - Absence of people suggests before/after
2. **Layer light sources** - Mix practical and ambient for depth
3. **Describe textures** - Materials define the feel of a space
4. **Include subtle motion** - Dust, wind, light shifts bring life
5. **Specify time precisely** - "2 AM after rain" not "nighttime"
6. **Reference visual artists** - Hopper, Malick, Wong Kar-wai communicate style
