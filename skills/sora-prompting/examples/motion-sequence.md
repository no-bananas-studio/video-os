## Tips for Motion Sequences

1. **Count the beats** - "At second two" is clearer than "then"
2. **One action chain** - Build movement in logical sequence
3. **Include pauses** - Stillness between movements reads as intentional
4. **Describe effort** - Breathing, muscle tension, concentration
5. **Match camera to motion** - Track walking, static for hands
6. **Rack focus for reveals** - Shift attention within static shot
