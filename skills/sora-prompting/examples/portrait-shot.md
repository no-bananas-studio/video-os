## Tips for Portrait Shots

1. **Specify lens** - 85mm for flattering, 35mm for environmental context
2. **Describe light direction** - Where is it coming from relative to camera?
3. **Time micro-expressions** - Small shifts in expression need clear beats
4. **Include eye behavior** - Where they look tells the story
5. **Match palette to mood** - Warm for intimate, cool for distant
